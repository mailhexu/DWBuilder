# DWBuilder: Domain Wall Builder
Ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain_wall_builder creates domain walls and interface structure for the perovskites and ceramics. The code reads the structure in the vasp format, and then creates domain walls with user-defined sizes and angles.

# Overview
There are three main scripts [dwbuilder.py](scripts/dwbuilder.py), [dbuilder.py](scripts/dbuilder.py) and [hibuilder.py](scripts/hibuilder.py) which build domain wall, single domain structures and experimentally observed atomic interface strutures with known orientation relationships (ORs), respectively. For the domain wall and interfaces, you only need to run [dwbuilder.py](scripts/dwbuilder.py). These scripts can be executed from the command line. I also have included examples of ferroelectric domain walls.

Dependencies
------------

The package requires:

-  **numpy** - http://www.numpy.org/
-  **metplotlib** - https://matplotlib.org/
-  **ASE** - https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
-  **Pymatgen** - https://pymatgen.org/

# Installation guide
For installation simply clone or download the code in your terminal and in the main directory of the package type:
```
> pip install .
```
This will copy the modules to your active python site-packages, thereby making them importable in any python script and will put the scrpits in the python bin, thereby making them executable in the shell.

After installation, you can start the software by running the following command in your terminal:
```
> dwbuilder
```
# Method for the development of FDW
## R3m
Ferroelectric materials with a rhombohedral space group of R3m exhibit three types of ferroelectric domain walls (FDWs): R71, R109, and R180. Due to neutrality and mechanical compatibility, these FDWs develop along specific planes. For the R180 FDW, the {1-10} plane is used, while for R71 and R109, the FDWs are determined by the sum of the two polarization vectors.

- **R71 FDW**: Lies parallel to the diagonal (1-10) plane in the primitive cell.
- **R180 FDW**: Developed along the {1-10} plane.
- **R109 FDW**: The R109 FDW lies along the (100) plane, and FDWs are simply developed by stacking the primitive cell along this direction.

To analyze the R71 and R180 FDWs, the pseudocubic rhombohedral unit cell is transformed into a 10-atom cell by rotating it 45Â° around the z-axis relative to the parent cubic unit cell. The transformation matrix applied is given as:

        [ 1  0  1 ]                
    T = [ 1  0 -1 ]       
        [ 0  1  0 ]        

In the script the above transformation matrix is applied in lattice vectors form as given below:

```
a=[1, 1, 0], b=[0, 0, 1], c=[1, -1, 0]

```

**R71**

The R71 domain walls are developed by stacking along the normal direction to the [1-10] plane, which aligns with the a-axis in the rotated coordinate system. Additionally, the mirror symmtry was developed by tranforming [1-10] to [-110] and from [001] to [00-1].

For the R71 FDWs, the orientation relationships for both domains (D1 and D2) are:

         [ 1  0  1 ]         [ 1  0 -1 ]          
    D1 = [ 1  0 -1 ]    D2 = [ 1  0  1 ]    
         [ 0  1  0 ]         [ 0 -1  0 ]  

**R180**

Similar to the R71 domain wall, the R180 {1-10} wall is also parallel to the diagonal plane in the primitive cell. For the R180 FDW:
- A supercell is made by stacking the rotated 10-atom unit cell.
- The final FDWs are developed by stacking along the ```[1-10]``` plane.

```
         [ 1  0  1 ]         [ -1  0   1 ]          
    D1 = [ 1  0 -1 ]    D2 = [ -1  0  -1 ]    
         [ 0  1  0 ]         [  0 -1   0 ]  

```

The transformation ensures that the polarization vectors in the two domains are oriented 180 degrees apart, achieving the necessary mirror symmetry for the R180 domain wall. 

**R109**

 The R109 FDW lies along the (100) plane. For this FDW:
 
- The domain walls are developed by stacking the primitive cell along the (100) direction.

This straightforward stacking ensures that the polarization vectors align as required for the R109 domain wall configuration.

```
         [ 1  0  0 ]         [  1  0   0 ]          
    D1 = [ 0  1  0 ]    D2 = [  0 -1   0 ]    
         [ 0  1  1 ]         [  0  0   -1 ]  

```
## R3c
Similar to the R3m , R3c also possess three FDWs R71, R109 and R180. The R3c domain walls are developed by converting reference R3c structure into a pseudocubic cell by cutting along (1-11) plane, which is also the polarization axis. The transformation vectors used to convert R3c structure into pseudocubic cell is given as:

```
          [  1 -1  1 ]                
    T = [  1  1 -1 ]       
          [ -1  1  1 ]        

```

The R71 , R109 , and R180 domain walls are found to adopt (001), (110), and (-110) pseudocubic domain wall planes, respectively.

# Usage
To execute the code, one should run the dwbuilder command from the command line. Upon running, the user will be prompted to input the name of the input structure file, as well as the domain wall angle and size (expressed in number of unit cells). This script builds the domain wall structure based on the space group of the input structure. For structures with the R3m or P4mm space groups, the polarization directions are assumed to align with the [001] direction. For structures with the R3c space group, a pseudo-cubic structure is first constructed by translating the input rhombohedral axes along ```a=[101], b=[-111], and c=[0-11]```. In the translated axis , the polarization direction is assumed to align with the ```[-110]``` direction.  To construct 109 and 71 domain walls, each crystal system is translated according to specific orientation relationships in order to meet the polarization angle requirement.

However, if you are unsure about the polarization dirction, you can run ```polarization.py``` to determine the polarization direction. This script uses the point charge model and you need to have both optimized ```CONTCAR``` and high symmtry structure ```POSCAR``` files to determine the polarization.

Once you have developed the desired domain wall structure, you can visualize in vesta or ase to further refine domain wall artifacts.  In the above examples, the domain walls are parallel along (001)//(001) planes.

So far the [dwbuilder.py](scripts/dwbuilder.py) develops the domain walls for the following space groups along with the assumed polarization directions:

```
R3c (Polarization direction (1-11))
R3m (Polarization direction (001))
P4mm (Polarization direction (001))
p6_3cm (Polarization direction (-1-10))
Pnma (Polarization direction (110))
Pmc2_1 (user-defined)
Amm2 (user-defined)
```

```
[hibuilder.py](scripts/hibuilder.py) generates an initial configuration that needs additional refinement along a, b and c-directions. To determine the optimal interface distance along the a, b, and c axes, you can either perform static DFT or forcefield simulations. Additionally, you may need to explore various interfacial configurations to identify the thermodynamically stable structure.

The above code generates the following interface structure (the periodic image) visualized by [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/):

![image](https://github.com/mzkhalid039/DWBuilder/assets/52278972/19081982-1949-4e16-a734-ca27a6d733bb)

It is also important to know that all the domain wall and interface structures built in this package follow the orthogonality condition, which means lattice vectors a,b and c are mutually perpendicular (i.e., orthognal) to each other and fulfill these conditions: 

```
a x b = c
a x c = b
b x c = a
```

- _**A note on the microscopic degrees of freedom:**_

To find the global minimum of an interface structure, it is essential to calculate the optimal distance between the different bulk phases at the interface. You also need to identify the termination site that corresponds to the structure with the lowest energy, as well as consider the homogeneous interface structures of the periodic images.

To achieve these goals, I often use first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT), specifically with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) at 0 Kelvin. This computational approach helps determine the initial structures for further first-principles calculations.
